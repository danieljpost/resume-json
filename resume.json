His ability to positively impact the short term needs of a project while also offering critical insights into the long term vision of the product is of great asset to anyone. He has an in depth understanding of product life cycles, software application design patterns, and system performance, among many other parallels. Ultimately his contract resulted in a successful mission. This is my highest level of recommendation."
