      "relationship": "Christopher managed Daniel J. directly at RAZR Marketing",
      "recommendation": "Daniel was brought to the team at a critical time in development and asked to take on substantial amounts of work with minimal orientation or guidance. I needed someone who was fluent in the more advanced aspects of PHP development and could tackle tough design and implementation decisions. He delivered on that demand at one of the highest proficiencies and accuracies that I have had the pleasure of working with. His ability to positively impact the short term needs of a project while also offering critical insights into the long term vision of the product is of great asset to anyone. He has an in depth understanding of product life cycles, software application design patterns, and system performance, among many other parallels. Ultimately his contract resulted in a successful mission. This is my highest level of recommendation."

The tool has been incredibly successful so far and is scaling well as the project grows at an enterprise level."
