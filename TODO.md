### Stuff currently not done, but should be done

1) [ ] Split Gigs out into gigs.json
1) [ ] Split Companies out into companies.json
1) [ ] Split Skills out into skills.json
1) [ ] and so forth
1) [ ] publish schema at https://eatthebillionaires.pro/schema/resume.schema.json et al.
1) [ ] push those things into mongodb for maintenance
1) [ ] write an API using express or Rust or whatever to serve those files as if they weren't just static data
1) [ ] find a good tool to serve those out also as an API with like GraphQL
1) [ ] find a new url shortener; danieljpost.net is moot
1) [ ] locate who recruited me for each of the last like 15 years worth of gigs, link them in LinkedIn
1) [ ] offer Career Profile and Career Highlights, per the attached PDF example, as the first element of resume - point being that the recruiter is only going to read page 1 anyway. Only robots look for the list of "relevant" skills which should be at the bottom of the exported page
